# Machine Learning (ML) Project
## Description
This github repository is intended to be used for and by the HALES/REYES summer students to save their work (relevant computer codes / notes) on this project. The main part of the project will consist of giving the students an introduction to a subfield of Machine Learning known as Deep Learning and is
concerned with teaching a machine (e.g., computer) how to process and interpret information inspired by how the human brain and nervous system work. Deep Learning incorporates artificial neural networks (ANNs) within its architecture 
to learn from data representations, contrary to task-based algorithms, i.e., traditional computer codes where the user assigns specific tasks to run. 

As a by-product of the main part (ML) of this project, the student will also learn Python programming (if they have not already been exposed to it), as well as how to utilize GitHub to organize/store their work projects.

## Tasks
The students will be assigned several tasks on a weekly basis to be completed by the end of each week, and we'll meet at the start of the following week to discuss the progress made and new tasks to be completed. The entire project will last from 4-6 weeks, after which the students can continue to work on the project if there is enough interest to do so. <br>
 
`First Week: June 28 - July 04` <br>

* Student/mentor introductions and determine weekly meeting times
* Discuss current knowledge of students on Python, GitHub and Machine Learning
* Help out students setup Python and Github if necessary and work out a few examples interactively 
* Assign reading/practice examples of the basics of GitHub and Python, as well as reading material on Neural Networks to start to become familiarized with the subject.
