# Machine Learning (ML) Project
## Description
This github repository is intended to be used for and by the HALES/REYES summer students to save their work (relevant computer codes / notes) on this project. The main part of the project will consist of giving the students an introduction to a subfield of Machine Learning known as Deep Learning and is
concerned with teaching a machine (e.g., computer) how to process and interpret information inspired by how the human brain and nervous system work. Deep Learning incorporates artificial neural networks (ANNs) within its architecture 
to learn from data representations, contrary to task-based algorithms, i.e., traditional computer codes where the user assigns specific tasks to run. 

As a by-product of the main part (ML) of this project, the student will also learn Python programming (if they have not already been exposed to it), as well as how to utilize GitHub to organize/store their work projects.

Students are encouraged to work together, and help out each other by having discussions
about the reading material and homework exercises assigned. 

You can contact me via email if there is any questions or concerns regarding the reading material/exercises assigned, and I will do my best to help. Keep in mind, this is a program to encourage  and foster independent research in the part of students, and there is a possibility I may not be able to answer some of your questions (hence, you will have to do research online)

**Mentor Information** <br>
Mentor Name: Carlos Yero <br> 
email: cyero002@fiu.edu

## Tasks
The students will be assigned several tasks on a weekly basis to be completed by the end of each week, and we'll meet at the start of the following week to discuss the progress made and new tasks to be completed. The entire project will last from 4-6 weeks, after which the students can continue to work on the project if there is enough interest to do so. <br>

The main homework assignments for each week consist of reading and doing the exercises from
a 4-post series written by Victor Zhou, who has worked as a Facebook Engineer, and has written this series intended for students without any previous knowledge of Neural Networks. After the introductory series to Neural Networks, we will also learn about Keras, a simple-to-use, but powerful deep learning library for Python to facilitate solving Neural Network problems, also written by Victor Zhou.<br> 

There is also a supplementary reading material (online blog article) written by Déborah Mesquita (data scientist) which can be used as supplementary material to the main Reading Material, and is strongly encouraged to read in order to learn about different concepts in Neureal Networks.

`First Week: August 02 - August 08, 2021` <br>

* Student/mentor introductions and determine weekly meeting times 

* Discuss REYES 2021 Mentoring Program expectations from students

* Discuss current knowledge of students on Python, GitHub and Machine Learning

* Help out students install and setup Github and Python if necessary <br> 
  ( see [github-installation](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and [python-installation](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Python#Mac) )
  
* Work out a few examples interactively of how to use Python and Github <br>
see python-examples: [An Informal Introduction to Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) <br> 
see github-examples: [fork-and-branch git workflow](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/) (specific example to help you setup a copy of this repository)

* Watch short (~8 min), informative YouTube video about Convolutional Neural Networks (see [CNNs video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRhxdVk_sIs)) <br>
(This video describes the basics of CNNs via an example of the most popular application: image/pattern recognition, which is what this mentoring program is mainly about.)

 #### 1st Week: Homework Assignment
* Read and work out the exercises/examples discussed in Part 1 of the series: <br>
[Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) 

`Second Week: August 09 - August 15, 2021` <br>

* Discuss homework assignment from the First Week 
  * I will help in solving any exercises the students had difficulty to complete 

 #### 2nd Week: Homework Assignment
We will skip Part 2, as it is an introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) which is out of the scope of this program.  You can briefly read about RNNs if you are interested in its applications.
  
* Read and work out the exercises/examples discussed in Part 3 of the series: <br>
[CNNs, Part 1: An Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/) 


`Third Week: August 16 - August 22, 2021` <br>

* Discuss homework assignment from the Second Week 
  * I will help in solving any exercises the students had difficulty to complete 

 #### 3rd Week: Homework Assignment
* Read and work out the exercises/examples discussed in Part 4 of the series: <br>
[CNNs, Part 2: Training a Convolutional Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-2/) 

`Fourth Week: August 23 - August 29, 2021` <br>

* Discuss homework assignment from the Third Week 
  * I will help in solving any exercises the students had difficulty to complete 

 #### 4th Week: Homework Assignment
* Read and work out the exercises/examples discussed in the Keras for Beginners series: <br>
[Keras for Beginners: Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network](https://victorzhou.com/blog/keras-cnn-tutorial/) <br>
This assignment is helpful for preparing the students for pattern recognition of more
complicated images. When we analyze real experimental data from Jefferson Lab, Experimental Hall C, we will make use of the Keras python library to facilitate computational cost of analyzing and recognizing patterns in highly complicated images. 

`Fifth/Sixth Weeks: August 30 - September 12, 2021` <br>
 
 * Discuss exercises using the Keras library and for the remaining two weeks, I will provide actual data from Hall C for pattern recognition. This task will require all the previously acquired knowledge of Neural Networks to apply to actual data. This is a work in progress I still need to think about how to provide this data from pixelated 2D color plots.
