% See https://www.bibtex.com/e/entry-types/

% To cite a biliographic entry in this file (references.bib),
% make sure that this file is included in the main_file.tex file you compile

% >>  \bibliography{references}
% >>  \bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}  %this line sets the bibliography style


% Each time a new bibliography entry is added to this file, and/or a reference is cites in the document (\cite{ref_key}, do the following:
% 1. pdflatex main_file.tex   (this updates the corresponding main_file.aux file with the new bib entry)
% 2. bibtex main_file.aux     (run bibtex on the auxilary file: bibtex is a reference management software)
%                              this command also creates a .bbl file, with ONLY the cited references sorted either alphabetically or by citation
% 3. pdflatex main_file.tex   (run this command two times, the reason is explained in reference:
