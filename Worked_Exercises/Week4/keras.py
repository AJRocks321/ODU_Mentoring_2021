# Building the Model
# (Using Sequential Class)
#--------------------------
'''
Every Keras model is either built using the Sequential class, which represents a 
linear stack of layers, or the functional Model class, which is more customizeable. 
Weâ€™ll be using the simpler Sequential model, since our CNN will be a linear stack of layers.
